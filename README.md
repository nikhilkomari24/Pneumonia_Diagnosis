# Pneumonia_Diagnosis
Pneumonia Diagnosis using Deep Learning Neural Networks such as CNN and RESNET50

Medical diagnosis using machine learning
techniques enables improved efficiency of doctors by
saving time. By producing best results consistently,
machine learning can help doctors in understanding a
patient’s history which ultimately facilitates in planning
and providing better care. This project’s main aim is to
implement a machine learning model which can perform
image classification (Pneumonia Diagnosis) effectively
using chest X-Ray images (of pediatric patients). We
analyzed and implemented CNN and RESNET50 using
original images, also CNN using pre-processed images to
classify images into two classes (Normal and Pneumonia).
Accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score are the metrics
used for the evaluation of model performance.
Additionally, minimizing the number of false negatives
obtained was given utmost importance as we are dealing
with a problem in medical field. Results obtained indicate
that CNN using original images is the best-performing
model followed by CNN using pre-processed images
(from N-Clahe technique) and RESNET50 using original
images.
